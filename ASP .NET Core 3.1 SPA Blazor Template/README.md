# ASP .NET Core SPA React Application Template

This project is a sample template built using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. It follow the CQRS + MediatR pattern and clean architecture principles.

## There are five base layers in the project.
1. Domain Layer - contains all entities, enums, exceptions, types and logic specific to the domain. The Entity Framework related classes are abstract, and should be considered in the same light as .NET Core. For testing, use an InMemory provider.
2. Application Layer - contains all application logic. It is dependent on the domain layer, but has no dependencies on any other layer or project. This layer defines interfaces that are implemented by outside layers.
3. Persistence Layer - contains database context, all configurations, migrations and data seed. It depends only on the application layer.
4. Presentation Layer - contains all presentation logic. There is client application based on React. Presentation layer depends only on application layer.
5. Common Layer - contains all cross-cutting concerns.
